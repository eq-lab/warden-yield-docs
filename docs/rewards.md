# Rewards

You'll be able to unstake and claim your rewards after the [Warden Protocol](https://wardenprotocol.org) and YieldWard go mainnet. The amount of rewards will be proportional to your **staked total amount**: the staked assets and the collected yield.

The currency of future rewards depends on the currency you've staked:

-   By staking **ETH**, **USDC**, or **USDT**, you'll earn **LP tokens** – YieldWard Liquidity Provider Tokens.
-   By staking [WARP](https://docs.wardenprotocol.org/tokens/warp-token/warp) (coming soon), you'll get more WARP from the 1:1.2 airdrop at the [Warden Protocol](https://wardenprotocol.org) mainnet launch. WARP holders will also benefit from 1:1 [WARD](https://docs.wardenprotocol.org/tokens/ward-token/ward) airdrop.


:::note 
Liquidity provider (LP) tokens are a reward mechanism to facilitate transactions between other different types of currencies. Decentralized exchanges rely on liquidity providers to ensure there is an always-on market for crypto trading.
