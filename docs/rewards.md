# Rewards

After [staking](stake) crypto, you'll receive daily rewards to your [WARD address](https://help.wardenprotocol.org/spaceward/connect-your-wallet).

:::tip 
Please note that you'll be able to unstake and claim your rewards only after the Warden Protocol and YieldWard go Mainnet. 
:::

## Currency

The currency of rewards depends on the currency you've staked:

-   By staking **ETH**, **USDC**, or **USDT**, you'll earn **LP tokens** – YieldWard Liquidity Provider Tokens.
-   By staking [WARP](https://docs.wardenprotocol.org/tokens/warp-token/warp) (coming soon), you'll earn [WARD](https://docs.wardenprotocol.org/tokens/ward-token/warp).

:::note 
Liquidity provider (LP) tokens are a reward mechanism to facilitate transactions between other different types of currencies. Decentralized exchanges rely on liquidity providers to ensure there is an always-on market for crypto trading. 
:::

## Amount

The amount of your rewards will be proportional to your staked total amount: the staked assets and the collected yield. As shown in [Manage your stake](manage-your-stake), you can always check the following details of your stake helping you to estimate your future rewards:

-   **APY**: Your annual percentage yield – the estimated interest you can earn annually.
-   **Earned**: The already earned reward.
