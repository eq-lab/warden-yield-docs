## Claim WARP bonuses

For staking each of the Ethereum Mainnet assets, you receive boosted % yield (APY) in [WARP tokens](https://docs.wardenprotocol.org/tokens/warp-token/warp) in the Base Mainnet.

You can start claiming bonuses when the earned amount is above **100 WARPs**. Please note that you can claim only **all WARP at once**.

1. Visit [YieldWard](https://yieldward.com).

2. In the top-right corner of the main page, click the WARP icon.

3. You'll see the total amount of WARP earned for all stakes. Click **Claim WARP**.

4. Approve the transaction in your wallet. Wait until it's confirmed.

5. If you wish to stake your WARP in the Base Mainnet, click **Stake**. Otherwise, click **Done**.

:::warning
Staking your WARP bonus will allow you to get WARD from the 1:1.2 airdrop on the Warden Protocol mainnet launch. Until then, your WARP will be locked.

:::note
If you don't stake WARP immediately, you can do it later, as shown in [Stake WARP](stake#stake-warp).
