# Earn rewards

## Overview

[Staking with YieldWard](stake) allows you to **earn rewards** on the [Warden Protocol](https://wardenprotocol.org) mainnet launch. You can also receive incentive rewards in WARP before the mainnet.

The reward amount will be proportional to your **staked total amount**: the staked assets and the collected yield. The currency of rewards depends on the currency you've staked, as shown in the sections below.

:::warning 
Please note that you'll be able to unstake and claim your rewards only after the Warden Protocol and YieldWard go mainnet. The only exception is [WARP bonuses](manage-your-stake#claim-warp-bonuses).

## Rewards for staking ETH/USDC/USDT

For [staking ETH/USDC/USDT](stake#stake-ethusdcusdt) on the Ethereum Mainnet, you'll receive two types of rewards:

- **YieldWard LP tokens**: After the Warden Protocol mainnet launch, you'll receive YieldWard LP tokens to your Warden address.

    LP tokens are Liquidity Provider Tokens – a reward mechanism to facilitate transactions between other different types of currencies. Decentralized exchanges rely on liquidity providers to ensure there is an always-on market for crypto trading.
    
- **WARP bonuses**: For each Ethereum Mainnet asset staked, you receive boosted % yield (APY) in [WARP](https://docs.wardenprotocol.org/tokens/warp-token/warp) tokens on the Base Mainnet. WARP is accrued daily. Also note that the boosted APY percentage is a variable that is going to change over time.

    You can claim your WARP before the Warden Protocol mainnet launch and then stake the reward if you wish, as explained in [Manage your stake](manage-your-stake#claim-warp-bonuses).

## Rewards for staking WARP

For [staking WARP](stake#stake-warp) on the Base Mainnet, you'll receive [WARD](https://docs.wardenprotocol.org/tokens/ward-token/ward) from the **1:1.2 airdrop** at the Warden Protocol  mainnet launch.
