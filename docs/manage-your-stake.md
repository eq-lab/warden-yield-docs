# Manage your stake


After [staking](stake), you can always manage your stake:

1. Visit [YieldWard]. On the main page, you'll see this:

	- Your total value locked (TVL)
	- The total staked amount
	- The staked amount of each currency

2. Select one of the currencies you've staked and click **Manage**.

3. On the next screen you can check your staked amount and the future annual percentage yield (APY).

4. To stake more, click **Stake More**.

:::tip 
You can [stake more](manage-your-stake) of the same asset but only using the **same Warden address**. However, you can use other Warden addresses for other assets.

Please note that you'll be able to unstake and claim your [rewards](rewards) after the [Warden Protocol](https://wardenprotocol.org) and YieldWard go mainnet.
